# Stefan Bemelmans Portfolio Repo!
I am a student at the Austin Coding Academy, in the advanced class of the JavaScript Full-Stack Engineering Program, about a month away from graduating. This repo contains what I feel are the highlights of my understanding of the material so far. I am about a month away from graduation as of this writing and it's the middle of August 2017. 

# CatFork!
This is an app I built at the end of the second semester, about 2 months ago. I use JS6, Babel and JSX in the React framework to deliver a recipe search experience based on enterable ingredients. The process relies on 2 API calls. The substance is the call to the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.api) api, querying the ingredients and returning the recipes. The second is the "cat" in CatFork. I discovered the [catApi](https://www.thecatapi.com) and I figured...because the internet. [Check It Out](./CatFork.index.html)
The newCat button gets a new random cat. 
If you don't have the time, these pictures recreate the experience of searching for "tomato, cheese, herbs", please enjoy:

 __OOOh Look at the Recipes!__ I know the PizzaBites look good but it's really just tomato sauce and cheese on a cracker.  
 __That heirloom salad looks great! If I press the button....__

__Yay CatFork!__
 
![alt text](http://thecatapi.com/api/images/get?format=src&size=medium) __New Cat!__ Ideally it's a different cat than the one immediately above.

That's CatFork! An excellent excercise in the handling of API calls and URL variables within the React framework.
Not a bad recipe app either. I'm expanding the functionality for a class project and comming soon will be:
* Login/User Base 
* Favorite Recipe/Cats Folders
* Expanding Search Functionality To Include Nutritional Info, Cusine, Ingredient Substitution
* Ingredient/Recipe Conversion, Including Pan-Size Adjustment For Things In Rimmed Pans! (something I've always wanted)

Feel free to contact me with suggestions or whatever!
