My public page,  Please standfast while I update to React! Enjoy CatFork!
CatFork is my first app. It's a recipe search based on ingredients. Plus pictures of cats. Unfortunately the "new cat" button doesn't 
work due to api calls over http as opposed to https but I'm trying to sort that out. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
